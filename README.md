# ThreeJS Journey

> God bless Ukraine.

This project comes with two parts:

 - My practice codes for the course **ThreeJS Journey**, but not all chapters are included.
 - A package named **DanceFloor**, it's a Vue binding for ThreeJS.

## DanceFloor

DanceFloor is located in `packages/dancefloor`. It was built with Vue 3, but in theory it compatible with Vue 2.7+.

This package is published to npm as the name `@lancercomet/dancefloor`.

## ThreeJS Journey

ThreeJS Journey is located in `three-js-journey`.
